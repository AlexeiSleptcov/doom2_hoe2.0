# Doom II. Hell on Extending

Large-scale expanding of the levels of the original series.  
I hope you enjoy it.

The original doom2.wad is required. 

# Description
More hardcore.The concept of DOOM has been rethought a bit.

As a kid, I always enjoyed playing doom, but in places the level design was a big question. Time passed, a rethinking of game design took place in the world, but despite this, I tried to find a compromise between the doom bible and the current perception of game design.

Anyway, this is a personal representation of what doom looks like in my eyes, and what I would like it to look like. And now the idiot's dream has come true, I hope you enjoy passing this variation of the Doom 2 game.
